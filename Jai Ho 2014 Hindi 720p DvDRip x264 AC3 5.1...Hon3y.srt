What a kid.

277
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:36,653
According to the rules,
teachers can't help you.

278

Hi. Suman.

Someone was supposed to come
and help her. he's not coming.

286

Why are you going that way?

293
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,894
Mom, that's a shortcut.
- I see.

294
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,171
Did you finish your lunch?
-Yes.

295
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,001
Doesn't Deepak live
in our neighborhood?

296
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,777
What were you
lecturing him on outside class?

297
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,977
Mom, he never attends school.

298
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,639
He's always making excuses.

299
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:31,579
Oh?
- Yes.

300
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:39,355
And now we have to solve
integration of trigonometric functions.

Yes.

302
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:44,186
Miss.

She's a very talented
and intelligent girl.

306
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:00,268
She never grieves over
her shortcoming.

307
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,144
She always scores first.

308
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,606
Just watch, someday.

309
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:07,946
..she will set an example in life.

310
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:10,051
Cos x+ Tan x..

311
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,383
And this comes after that.

312
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:13,915
Slowly. okay.

313
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,728

tired even at the gym.

314
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:20,289
Miss.
- Yes

315
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:22,333
Can I get a paper and pen?

Here you go?

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,035
Yeah, we're done.

318
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,630
Full stop?
- Full Stop.

319
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:32,039
Everybody pens down and leave.

320
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,976
Thank you, Jai.
-Welcome.

321
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:39,239
Thanks.
- Here you go.

322
00:22:40,206 --> 00:22:41,207
Jai.
- Thank you.

323
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,085
What's this?

324
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:49,717
“Concentrate on your spellings,
don't fail...her."

325
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:51,090
Your sister sent this.

326
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:53,094
Very funny.

327
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:54,154
500, sir.

328
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,164
500?

329
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:57,800
Why do these
multiplexes overcharge so much?

330
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,270
Now I understand why the masses

331
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,963
"don't come to the
multiplex to watch a film.

332
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,736
Why are you so furious, today?
- Nothing, uncle.

333
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:08,267
Our new neighbor.
she troubles me a lot.

334
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:11,280
Why?
- She keeps teasing me "tiny, tiny".

335
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:14,743
Tiny?
- One day I was taking a bath.

336
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:16,218
She barged inside without knocking.

337
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,184
Since then she's been teasing me that.

338
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:22,989
Were you bathing with
cold water or hot water?

339
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:23,993
How silly?

340
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,791
What difference does that make?

341
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:27,694
It makes a big mistake.

342
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:30,859
So, always close the
bathroom door while bathing.

343
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,368
Jai, please take her to the bathroom.

344
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:36,205
Hold this.
- Uncle, I want to go to the bathroom.

345
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:40,039
Yes, dear. Come.

348
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,318
Uncle, let's go.
-Yes, dear.

349
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:51,219

Same pinch.
<i>_</i> "Why?"

361

No.

Suman, only 15 minutes

Everyoneis quite worried.

439
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,665
They are fools.

And the ones who are bothering them..

441
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:59,498

Kavita Singh Patil?

493
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,762
The Home Minister's daughter?

494
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:14,762
Yes.

495
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,664
Do you know what you're doing?

496
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,796
Please take down my report.

497
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,299
You don't know what happened with me.

498
00:31:22,461 --> 00:31:24,441
I was stuck in traffic because of her.

499
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,232
My handicapped sister
was waiting for me..

500
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,334
Hello!
- I had to go write her exam.

501
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:29,344
Sir, Siddiqui here.

502
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:57,630
What are you doing?

503
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:01,770
Whose child is this?
- My child.

504
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:05,282
What's his name?
- His name..

505
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:06,975
L...L...Lakhan.

506
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:10,810
She's fortunate that
the child was found.

507
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:12,787
I heard some beggar stole him away.

508
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:14,824
I just went in the
general store for two minutes.

509
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,484
That's when someone abducted him.

510
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:17,390
He's been found now.

511
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:20,463
Thank the Lord that he
was found safe and sound.

512
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,497
Yes.

513
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:24,392
Jai, you've done a great job.

514
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:26,600
Thank you and God bless you.

515
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:30,505
Seriously,
how do we repay this favor?

516
00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:31,798
How can we help?

517
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:44,346
If you feel...
we've done you a favor.

518
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:46,516
Then don't say thank you.

519
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,920
Instead...help three people.

520
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:59,301
And...ask those three.
to help another three people.

521
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:05,306
I didn't get you, son.

522
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:07,741
Hold this.

523
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:13,680
Just like l helped you.
you will help three more people.

524
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:17,415
And you will ask them to
help three more people.

525
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:20,021
So 3 into 3 is 9.

526
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:23,359
Into 3...27.

527
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:27,022
27 into 3 is 81.

528
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:29,960
When 81 people help 3 more...
-243.

529
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:31,527
|nt0 3?

530
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:33,331
729

531
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:37,870
When 729 people help..
-2187.

532
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:40,672
Into 3.
- 6561.

533
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:44,437
Into 3?
- 19683.

534
00:33:44,503 --> 00:33:47,712
Into 3?
- 59049.

535
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:52,380
59049 into 3?
- 170.147.

536
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:59,990
And if 170, 147 people help 3 more'?

537
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,823
And when they help three more?

538
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:07,062
Then we'll have to call Shakuntala Devi.

539
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,798
430,416,721.

540
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:12,833
Correct?
- That's correct.

541
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:13,935
Wow!

542
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,742
And similarly this help chain..

543
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:19,748
...will grow from thousands to millions.

544
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,117
Son, that's a great idea.

545
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:28,016
We will definitely help three
people when we get the chance.

546
00:34:38,624 --> 00:34:39,625
Amazing.

547
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:41,497
He turned such a regular thought.

548
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,766
"into such a big ideology.

549
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:45,432
You're right.
people should understand.

550
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:46,974
But he's right.

551
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:48,611
Brother-in-law's a genius.

552
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:51,106

553
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,846
Proud of you.

Take care.

555
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:01,720
Hey!

556

Are you Geeta's brother?
- Yes.

559
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:11,726
But she's gone to the market.

560
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:14,928
I suggest that you come
and wait here.

561
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:16,969
Come on.

562
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,168

564
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,805
Come in.

571
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:46,068
And that Bharat tries to hit on me.

He?!

576
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:00,617
Are you watching your
autobiography in my home?

577
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:01,776
Switch it off.

578
00:36:05,544 --> 00:36:07,854
Tiny, now listen to my English.

579
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:10,052
I have to go to a call
centre for an interview.

580
00:36:10,716 --> 00:36:12,923
Hello. Good evening, sir.

581
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:15,089
You're talking to Rinky Shah.

582
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:17,800
No, sir. Not Rickshaw.

583
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,199
Rinky Shah.

584
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:22,065
Get rid of this.

585
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:27,167
How can I assist you. sir?

586
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,544
This pillow's such a nuisance.

587
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,810
Where does mother get these from ?

588
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:37,579
You fool! What are you doing?

589
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:39,122
What's wrong?
- Look behind.

590
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:40,053
What?

591
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:45,121
Spice...tea!

592
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,921
Jai. What are you doing here?

593
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,192
Geeta. Physical touch.

594
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:52,699
Wait.

595
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:53,668
What, Jain
- Nothing.

596
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:55,261
Her daughter was mistaken.

597
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:57,238
She mistook me for Kabir.

598
00:36:58,196 --> 00:36:59,038
You?

599
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:01,634
You two know each other?

600
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,906
Yes, I know you. It's you.

601
00:37:02,968 --> 00:37:06,177
Inside the theatre,
small girl, pink..

602
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:08,246
Pink?
- Okay, sorry.

603
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,085
Pink is our favorite.

604
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:11,780
<i>mky-pinky-ponky-</i>

605
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:13,824
Let's go. Kabir must be waiting.

606
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:16,251
He's a nice boy.

607
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:18,153
<i>Seem .</i>

608
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,718
What does your brother do?

609
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:21,162
He was in the army.

610
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:23,898
Was?

611
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:26,568
Mother. I guess he got
scared and ran away.

612
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:28,664
Let's go.

613
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:29,296
Come on.

614
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,969
Stupid girl.
Don't talk nonsense.

615
00:37:33,632 --> 00:37:34,269
Let's go.

616
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,543
Sister, I am really sorry.

617
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:49,923
The reason my
brother left the military...

618
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,661
..was his bravery,
not cowardice.

619
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:01,863
Captain. Captain.

620
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:03,235
Captain, come in.
-Yes, sir.

621
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:05,002
We have lost a lot of men

622
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,268
Leave that area now.

623
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:08,834
End the mission right now.
- No. sir.

624
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,107
Innocent children have
been taken as hostage.

625
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:12,842
Soldier. control your anger.

626
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,247
Sir, try and understand.

627
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:15,842
Civilians are involved here.

628
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:17,649
It's the high-command's orders.

629
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:18,915
You have to fall back.

630
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:22,751
Get down. dammit.

631
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:23,315
Get down now.

632
00:38:23,582 --> 00:38:24,822
Clear the area now.

633
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:29,096
Captain Arjun, come in.

634
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:31,361
Abort this mission right now.

635
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:33,625
This is High-command's order.

636
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,594
Listen to me.

637
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:53,981
“Jai ho!"

638
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:04,060
“Jai ho!"

639
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:36,153
And Jai was suspended
from the army..

640
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,358
..for not obeying the
High Command's orders.

641
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:45,062
Sorry, sister.

642
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:52,365
It's okay.
- Thank you.

643
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:58,481
No thank you,

644
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,972
Whenever you get a chance.

645
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:06,212
And ask them to help
three more people.

646
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,358
Yes.

647
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:10,985
That's Jails ideology.

648
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:16,194
You don't have to be in the army..

649
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:20,066
..or be a politician
to serve the country.

650
00:41:22,761 --> 00:41:24,536

“And makes my heart crave."

670
00:43:53,945 --> 00:44:01,488
“Slowly these events move ahead."

“Your eyes.."

681
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,733
What do I say, sister?

682
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:15,638

Let's meet next week.

729
00:47:17,215 --> 00:47:18,888
Be safe, and don't drink and drive.

730
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:22,220
Sir, he's drunk.

731
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:23,527
He does that every day.

732
00:47:25,557 --> 00:47:26,695
Uncle.

733
00:47:27,392 --> 00:47:30,896
Is there anyone with you'?
- No, I am alone.

734
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:32,331
Uncle, it's quite late.

735
00:47:32,397 --> 00:47:33,398
Go home.

736
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:38,805
I am tired of waiting
for a rickshaw or taxi.

737
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,844
But no one's prepared
to go to Vasant Nagar.

738
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,878
I'll take a look.

739
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:46,814
Rickshaw!

740
00:47:50,515 --> 00:47:51,186
Come. uncle.

741
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:52,660
The rickshaw's here.

742
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:54,754
Come. Careful.

743
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:57,833
Very good.

744
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,260
Where do you want to go'?

745
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:02,601
Where to?

746
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:03,331
Uncle.

747
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:04,600
Uncle, give him your address.

748
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,439
Cottage no.5.

749
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,375
Vasant Nagar, West.

750
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,501
My rickshaw‘s from Mira Nagar.

751
00:48:10,568 --> 00:48:11,706
And I don't get a fare back.

752
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:12,839
Find yourself another rickshaw.

753
00:48:12,904 --> 00:48:14,713
Let it be, he's old and also drunk.

754
00:48:14,906 --> 00:48:16,715
So, will he get in my rickshaw?

755
00:48:16,808 --> 00:48:18,515
I won't get a return fare either.

756
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:20,487
Where will he go at this late hour?

757
00:48:20,845 --> 00:48:22,222
Fine, let's go.

758
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:23,824
Thank you.

759
00:48:24,716 --> 00:48:26,195
No need to thank me.'

760
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:30,430
Just help three people
whenever you get a chance.'

761
00:48:32,824 --> 00:48:34,804
Uncle, no need to thank me.'

762
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:38,202
Just help three people
whenever you get a chance.

763
00:48:40,465 --> 00:48:42,308
We've reached your home.

764
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:47,342
You brought me to the right place.

765
00:48:48,506 --> 00:48:51,749
From today I am your fixed client.
- Great.

766
00:48:53,578 --> 00:48:54,955
Keep it.

767
00:48:56,214 --> 00:48:57,284
Thank you.

768
00:48:58,216 --> 00:48:59,923
On 'Jan-Manch' today we're talking..

769
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:01,793
..about security of VV|P..

770
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:03,423
Better learn these chores, Ann.

771
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:05,434
It will come in handy
after marriage, dear.

772
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,299
By the way, it's not important for me.

773
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:10,430
But it will be great if she learns it.

774
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:13,772
How hard are you going to try, Sumit’?

775
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:14,935
Mom, you too.

776
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,772
Hold on, let me hear.

777
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:20,509
How justified is it spend the
common man's earning like this.

778
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:23,851
And other than that,
when VIP convoy‘s

779
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:28,483
..set out on roads, the common
man has to face difficulties.

780
00:49:28,613 --> 00:49:31,958
We'll now talk to our
Chief Minister Ashok Pradhan.

781
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:34,320
So, Mr. Ashok Pradhan,
what would you like to say?

782
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:36,629
You know, honestly.

783
00:49:36,988 --> 00:49:39,798
Security measures
shouldn't trouble the people.

784
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:42,531
..or it should trouble
them as less as possible

785
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:46,700
Unfortunately.
politicians are human beings too.

786
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:49,512
And human beings make mistakes.

787
00:49:50,468 --> 00:49:53,574
The only problem, when a
politician makes a mistake.

788
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:56,318
..the common man has to pay for it.

789
00:49:56,574 --> 00:49:58,576
What do you think about the new CM?

790
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,821
He's given a diplomatic answer.

791
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,587
The most important issue is..

792
00:50:03,915 --> 00:50:07,021
..when people misuse
the security system.

793
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:13,494
We'll take strict actions against them.

794
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:15,327
There's a positive vibe.

795
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:16,633
He looks like a nice man.

796
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:18,605
Good man.

797
00:50:18,663 --> 00:50:20,609
What's the point
if he is a nice man?

798
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:23,067
He's a puppet after all.

799
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:24,369
No, he's a nice man.

800
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:25,345
I heard it too.

801
00:50:25,403 --> 00:50:26,006
Forget that.

802
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,515
Jai, give me your hand.

803
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:28,940
Shake hands.

804
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,484
I did it.

805
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,578
Jai‘s formula,
to help three people.

806
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,350
..instead of saying thank you.

807
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:35,652
I spread that ahead.

808
00:50:36,514 --> 00:50:38,016
Come on, food's ready.

809
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:39,823
Let's eat.

810
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:42,622
Have you heard
the latest about him?

811
00:50:42,754 --> 00:50:43,926
Quiet.
- What happened?

812
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:47,559
He has donated his eyes.

813
00:50:48,526 --> 00:50:51,006
And owing to his actions these days..

814
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:53,838
..seems like someone
will soon get an eyesight.

815
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:55,069
Shut up'!

816
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:57,444
That's the limit.

817
00:50:57,502 --> 00:50:58,776
Curse you.

818
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:02,339
Look. Jai. I want to explain you something.

819
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:04,850
Not everyone in this world is like you.
- Are you crazy?

820
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:07,082
And given to the conditions these days..

821
00:51:07,345 --> 00:51:10,656
...everyone's busy
with their own problems.

822
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:13,385
Everyone will willingly vouch to help.

823
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:15,021
But no one will do it.

824
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:17,661
And look, Jai.

825
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:19,992
You've to make me a promise.

826
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:23,631
If your idea doesn't prospen.

827
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:25,804
..then you won't be disappointed.

828
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,606
I won't be, mom.

829
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:33,972
Chill.

830
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:37,152
What chill..

831
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:38,443
Really.

832
00:51:42,013 --> 00:51:43,754
This thought is so nice and noble..

833
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:45,522
..that I definitely want to help.

834
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:46,926
But I just got married.

835
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:48,725
And that's why I was very busy.

836
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:50,424
So I didn't get a chance or time.

837
00:51:50,488 --> 00:51:52,729
But as soon <i>as</i> I get
some time or opportunity.

838
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,792
...I will definitely help.
- No problem.

839
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:56,802
We haven't forgotten what you did.

840
00:51:57,595 --> 00:51:59,131
We even remember your thought.

841
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:01,811
We want to take it forward too.

842
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:04,670
But the past few days.

843
00:52:04,802 --> 00:52:07,180
..we've been doing rounds of
the visa and passport office.

844
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:09,614
My son Ronnie and his wife..

845
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:11,483
..are migrating to Canada.

846
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:18,023
No one helps anyone here,
or wants to.

847
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,456
Everyone's busy with
their own problem.

848
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:26,924
Some are worried about a job.
some about finding a girl.

849
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,469
I've seen the world.

850
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:32,635
I speak straight.

851
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:38,604
Some will say sweetly,
some will say it decently.

852
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:43,609
Some will say
“l want to help you".

853
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:48,688
Ask him...
did you do anything?

854
00:52:52,884 --> 00:52:53,862
Did you?

855
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:04,938
He'll say
“| didn't do anything".

856
00:53:06,731 --> 00:53:09,211
You're living in an illusion..

857
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:11,138
..that somethings going to happen.

858
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:14,974
Nothing's going to happen.

859
00:53:19,777 --> 00:53:20,755
Fine, sir.

860
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:21,882
The times are bad.

861
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:24,186
No one helped anyone.

862
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:25,990
Why don't you start?

863
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,620
n might make you happy-

864
00:53:31,055 --> 00:53:32,227
Nonsense!

865
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:42,843
Sorry, sir.

866
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,276
I shouldn't have said
that to you.

867
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:49,584
I apologies.

868
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:05,900
Sir. Sir..

869
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:07,001
Sir.

870
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:09,728
This is yours.

871
00:54:10,061 --> 00:54:11,005
This is yours.

872
00:54:13,798 --> 00:54:15,277
Oh no. Come on.

873
00:54:15,566 --> 00:54:16,601
I'm packed too.

874
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:17,541
Forget it.

875
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:19,673
Jai, whether anyone
does anything or not.

876
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:20,848
We will try.

877
00:54:20,905 --> 00:54:21,542
Yes.

878
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:23,551
Sir, I am hungry.

879
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:26,179
Please give something.
- I said get lost.

880
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:27,779
lam hungry.
- Get lost.

881
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:29,119
Who talks to a child that way?

882
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:30,819
Sir, I am hungry.

883
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:31,724
Give me some money.

884
00:54:31,816 --> 00:54:33,159
I said get lost.

885
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:35,187
Jai.

886
00:54:35,553 --> 00:54:36,861
Jai.
-Jai.

887
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:38,025
Jai, listen to me.

888
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:38,692
Jai.

889
00:54:38,756 --> 00:54:39,257
Child.

890
00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:41,965
Sumit, she's bleeding.

891
00:54:42,793 --> 00:54:44,602
What have you done?
- What's your problem?

892
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:46,038
Jai, leave it.
- Prob|em..

893
00:54:46,096 --> 00:54:47,302
Hey!

894
00:54:48,032 --> 00:54:48,908
Oh, God!

895
00:54:48,966 --> 00:54:50,138
Stop it.

896
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:53,277
We're trying to help
three people here, and you..

897
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:54,315
Forget it.

898
00:54:54,572 --> 00:54:55,676
Jai, let him go.

899
00:54:55,906 --> 00:54:57,010
Jai, control yourself.

900
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:57,677
Take it easy.

901
00:54:57,742 --> 00:54:58,812
Get lost.

902
00:54:59,043 --> 00:54:59,987
Just chill.

903
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,351
Poor girl.

904
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:06,121
Just chill.

905
00:55:06,217 --> 00:55:07,195
I won't spare you.

906
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:08,825
Get lost.

907
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:12,990
Jai, you hit the window.

908
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:15,670
I didn't see it was closed.

909
00:55:15,726 --> 00:55:16,864
Tend to the child.

910
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:19,205
Are you fine?

911
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:21,799
It's a minor injury.

912
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:23,641
There's a limit to being cruel.

913
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:25,112
What happened, dear?

914
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:27,682

Father?

What father?

918
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:32,780
He was playing cards.

919
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:33,821
He's hale and healthy.

920
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:36,817
You're absolutely fine.
and making your child beg.

921
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:38,085
What kind of a father are you?
-Jai.

922
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:38,889
Jai. Jai.

923
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:39,859
I told you to relax.

924
00:55:40,718 --> 00:55:42,891
Do one thing, apply this.
-Yes.

925
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:46,793
Look after yourself, dear.

926
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:49,202
Come on.

927
00:56:04,008 --> 00:56:05,783
What's wrong?
- Why is brother-in-law so depressed?

928
00:56:06,077 --> 00:56:06,885
Something happened?

929
00:56:07,011 --> 00:56:09,048
Nothing. he picked
a fight on the road.

930
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:09,817
With whom?

931
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,688
Forget it brother-in-law.

932
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:11,749
You know Jai.

933
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:12,893
What's wrong. Jai?

934
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:16,124
lam disturbed, what else?

935
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:20,296
Look at the chain of events.

936
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:24,966
One after the other.

937
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:28,975
A girl whom I helped out
of the blue".

938
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,974
..committed suicide
in front of me.

939
00:56:33,304 --> 00:56:36,114
I find a kidnapped boy.

940
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:41,013
A poor girl gets
beaten up while begging.

941
00:56:42,346 --> 00:56:46,852
The more I try to run from reality".

942
00:56:50,788 --> 00:56:52,893
Why do only I see these things?

943
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:55,266
Everyone sees them, Jai.

944
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:58,867
Others ignore it.

945
00:57:02,066 --> 00:57:04,103
You must have heard people saying.

946
00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:07,245
“L went out of my way to help him."

947
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,316
This “Out of the way" is your way.

948
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:13,715
Because that's who you are.

949
00:57:13,978 --> 00:57:16,424
And that's what
separates you from the rest.

950
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,288
You're not meant to spend.

951
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:22,422
..the rest of your life in a garage.

952
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:25,093
You will bring a change.

953
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:30,127
I believe it.

954
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,742
How and when, we just
have to wait and watch.

955
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:37,803
I believe it.

956
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:42,314
Evil is like poison,
it spreads fast.

957
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:44,182
And goodness,
is like a medicine.

958
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:47,480
It takes time,
but it's effective.

959
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:48,246
Cheers.

960
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:50,292
Fatty, why don't you
come to school these days?

961
00:57:50,348 --> 00:57:53,056
The school's too far,
I've to walk.

962
00:57:53,117 --> 00:57:54,187
I get tired.

963
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,855
Here, take my cycle.

964
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:58,961
This will help you exercise,
and no more excuses.

965
00:57:59,023 --> 00:58:01,264
Thank you.
- Don't say thank you.

966
00:58:01,325 --> 00:58:04,306
Just help three people
whenever you get the chance.

967
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,773
And ask them to help
more three people.

968
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:07,934
Get that.

969
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:12,879
Hey, uncle.
- Get lost.

970
00:58:18,476 --> 00:58:19,784
Where are you, darling?

971
00:58:19,944 --> 00:58:21,855
I've been waiting for you.

972
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:27,222
Wow, mom. What a place.

973
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:29,264
I love this place.
- Isn't it?

974
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:31,195
Hey, this was my idea.

975
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:33,963
Uncle, I love you.

976
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:36,271
Love you.
- He's so audacious.

977
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:38,102
What is he made of?

978
00:58:41,332 --> 00:58:42,402
I'll call you later.

979
00:58:42,466 --> 00:58:43,877
Uncle, let's go.

980
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:44,969
Come on, uncle.

981
00:58:45,036 --> 00:58:45,980
Don't be so slow. uncle.

982
00:58:46,036 --> 00:58:47,379

00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,412
We'll take care of him today.

986
00:58:57,181 --> 00:58:59,422
Strawberry flavor. uncle.

987
00:59:00,084 --> 00:59:01,995
Uncle, since the theatre.

988
00:59:02,052 --> 00:59:04,464

990
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:10,427

"My name's pinky."

996
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:25,949

And time for mom's walk as well.

00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:31,259
Yes, I'll take her too.
